# Age-Based-Disease-Prediction
Predicting the diseases using machine learning algorithms while considering age and symptoms as features.
<br>

The rapid growth in technology leads to the evolution in many sectors one of them being the health sector Where in the health sector Machine learning is playing a vital role in predicting disease. This work depicts the prediction of disease through Machine Learning by training the data with the ML algorithms such as Naïve Bayes, Decision Tree, Logistic Regression,KNN, and Random Forest trained on the provided dataset. Age is taken as the input from the user as symptoms may vary by age and pass the datasets through training and evaluate the metrics. The best algorithm is determined by the accuracy and f1_score

<p>Geriatric Disease Prediction: A Study on Age-Based Disease Prognostication by G. Dhekshagna, G. Sushmitha, and U. Sairam explores the application of supervised machine learning algorithms in predicting diseases based on age groups. The study, presented at the ICECAA 2023 Conference, addresses the challenge faced by medical professionals in analyzing large volumes of electronic health data to diagnose diseases early. It emphasizes the use of multiple machine learning models to identify high-risk patients by segregating symptoms according to age groups (1-14, 15-55, and 55+). The research evaluates the performance of various models including Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, and Naïve Bayes, concluding that the Random Forest model shows the highest efficacy in disease prediction, while Decision Tree models often provide superior accuracy. The study aims to improve early diagnosis and prognosis of geriatric diseases, ultimately enhancing patient care through technology-driven insights.</p>
