Predicting the diseases using machine learning algorithms while considering age and symptoms as features.
<p>Geriatric Disease Prediction: A Study on Age-Based Disease Prognostication by G. Dhekshagna, G. Sushmitha, and U. Sairam explores the application of supervised machine learning algorithms in predicting diseases based on age groups. The study, presented at the ICECAA 2023 Conference, addresses the challenge faced by medical professionals in analyzing large volumes of electronic health data to diagnose diseases early. It emphasizes the use of multiple machine learning models to identify high-risk patients by segregating symptoms according to age groups (1-14, 15-55, and 55+). The research evaluates the performance of various models including Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, and Na√Øve Bayes, concluding that the Random Forest model shows the highest efficacy in disease prediction, while Decision Tree models often provide superior accuracy. The study aims to improve early diagnosis and prognosis of geriatric diseases, ultimately enhancing patient care through technology-driven insights.</p>
